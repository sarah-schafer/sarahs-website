This website serves as a personal profile and portfolio, in order to represent my learning and skills thus far in my college career.  Thank you for visiting my website!

I developed this website using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), using skills I learned in INFO 340: Web Development.
